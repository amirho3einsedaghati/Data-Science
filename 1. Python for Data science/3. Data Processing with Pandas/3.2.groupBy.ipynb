    "Sometimes we want to select data based on groups and understand aggregated data on a group level. We have seen that even though Pandas allows us to iterate over every row in a dataframe, it is geneally very slow to do so. Fortunately Pandas has a groupby() function **to speed up such task**. The idea behind the **groupby()** function is that **it takes some dataframe, splits it into DataFrame chunks based on some key values, applies computation on those chunks, then combines the results back together into another dataframe**. In pandas this is refered to as the **split-apply-combine pattern**.\n"
